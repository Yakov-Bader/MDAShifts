MDA shifts           
in a list, that each location represents a user, and the value presents how much shifts he got, write a lgorithm that will give the lowest standard deviation.

the algorithim:
1) for each shift, give the sift to the people with the lowest amount of shifts given to them until now.
2) take the person with le lowest amount of shifts, and exchange him with the person with the most shifts, until the standard deviation does not srink.
3) do stage 2 with the rest of the people under the avg (order from low to high), until the standard deviation does not shrink
